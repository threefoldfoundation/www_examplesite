### Run websites using Gitpod workspace
 - Make sure to install gitpod extension in your browser from [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/)
 - To allow the website tab to be opened directly in new tab at your browser after build, go to your browser setting and allow pop-up windows (optional).
 - If you want to open mannualy and escape the previous step, press **ctrl+click** (Mac) on the link in terminal ``` Site running at: http://localhost:8080/  ```
