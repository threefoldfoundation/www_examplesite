bio = "Throughout my life, I have always searched for ways to express my skills and experience for good, from my Emmy-award winning work to democratise TV & Film production, to many years working for a left-wing TV news network, to running a food business accelerator aimed at fixing the broken food system, to hosting music events for charity. In ThreeFold I’ve found the ultimate mission of my career; a chance to truly have an impact on the future of humankind. It feels like my entire career has led up to this point, and I’m thrilled to have finally arrived."
