# ThreeFold Foundation (The TF Grid)

## About

Today's internet is fundamentally broken. Less than 60% of the world has access, it is being fragmented into pieces, its users (and their data) are exploited by big corporations, and it consumes up to 10% of the world's energy. It is powered by large, centralized data centers which benefit specific geographic regions and leave the rest behind.
The *ThreeFold Grid* is the answer. "Nodes" distributed around the world and owned by independent [ThreeFold Farmers](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/what_is_a_farmer) create the physical infrastructure that empowers a new, democratized, peer-to-peer internet based on our values of equality (access), autonomy (digital sovereignty), and sustainability (for our planet).
The ThreeFold Foundation is a non-profit based out of Belgium which, along with its partners, advocates for the adoption, growth, and expansion of the ThreeFold Grid and a new peer-to-peer internet.

## Mission

Growing a green and responsible peer-to-peer Internet that is available everywhere and owned by everyone – across geographical and cultural borders, empowering people to be digitally independent and providing equal chances to learn, partake and succeed.

## Impact

ThreeFold's Grid will help to give data sovereignty back to people and countries, give access to information, knowledge, communication and financial tools and more, to billions of people in countries lacking in internet infrastructure and help dramatically reduce the footprint of our current internet by using smaller and more efficient mini data nodes.

## Powered by ThreeFold

The ThreeFold Grid provides a global mesh network to run and store our internet applications and services. It is the fundamental backbone of a new internet that empowers our planet and humanity.

## Join saving our planet!

The world needs a new, more responsible internet – one that is more accessible, empowers its users, and minimizes energy consumption. If not us, who? If not now, when?

## Support this project

TF Foundation is included in ThreeFold’s [Token Distribution Event (TDE)](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/tdeoverview)</a> for the impact it brings to our planet, humanity and the ThreeFold Grid.
The ThreeFold Token (TFT) represents a unit of capacity on the new Internet and is created only when new capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid.
Each project on the TDE benefits from TFT fund allocations. You can buy TFT's and support TF Foundation, and the growth of a new Conscious Internet.

description = "Our project is about promoting the adoption and expansion of ThreeFold Grid in order to empower a new and democratized digital economy based on our values of equality, autonomy and sustainability. ThreeFold's Grid will help to give data sovereignty back to people and countries, as well as enable accessibility to internet access to billions of people in countries lacking in internet infrastructure, and finally it will help dramatically reduce the footprint of our current internet by using smaller and more efficient mini data nodes, less fiber network, a unique storage algorithm, and more. The ThreeFold Grid is one of the most essential elements of building a new internet as it provides a global network to run and store our internet applications and services. Today we are live with more than 80,000,000 GB of capacity and 25,000 CPU cores across 22 countries. We have launched the ThreeFold Grid SDK meaning that anyone can begin to utilize the ThreeFold Grid. We are currently talking with more than 25 blockchain projects out of top 200 to invite them to explore possible use cases on the ThreeFold Grid. And we have a number of other partners ready to host or build on top of the ThreeFold Grid. The success of our efforts can be measured by the growth of the ThreeFold Grid in terms of number of hardware nodes, the amount of capacity utilized on the ThreeFold Grid and the number of projects using and promoting the ThreeFold Grid."
