bio = "Farmers hold the key to a more sustainable society. With smallholder farmers and farm workers in the tropics and in relation to value chain partners, including retail and consumers, I'm seeking for a more equitable wealth distribution. More income and profits for farmers is needed. For many of them, their business case is still way too thin.There are ways out. Larger farm scale, more investments to forward integration, diversified production and trade. Once profitable, farmers can practice regenerative and climate smart agriculture. They can be the center of any healthy and sustainable food system, and ultimately can find access to high value ánd high impact markets. Both to international markets, as well as to local urban markets. Female entrepreneurs are gradually taking the lead in this transition.My dream is to support practices that create well-being with the poorest farmers and workers on our globe through smart and achievable solutions. These solutions will contribute to a transition towards a society in solidarity and operating within planetary bounderies. "
