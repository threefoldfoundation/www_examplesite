bio: Lawrence’s inquisitive nature has led him on a most amazing life’s journey. He has taken the Bodhisattva Initiation direct from His Holiness the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, and been on pilgrimage to Mt. Kailash with Sadhguru. He has sat in contemplation, in the oldest Taoist temple in Xian, together with the leading Taoist monk and the Taoist advisor to the Chinese Politburo. Lawrence believes that we need to rediscover our true relationships with the earth, the cosmos, each other and ourselves. In an attempt to absorb the deep wisdom of our indigenous brothers and sisters, to share snd embody their harmonious and symbiotic relationships, he has amongst other adventures, spent seven days of intense initiation with both the Kogi in the mountains at Santa Marta, Columbia, and with the Pygmies in an equatorial rainforest in Gabon. He also has had time to sit on the executive committee of a multinational company; developed a sustainability manual with HRH Prince Charles; Chaired a Global Agenda Council in Davos, and a UN Council on Green Cities. He is Secretary General of a UN Intergovernmental Organisation, Co-Founder of a hotel JV with the Universal Music Group, and should have died in a train crash close to Machu Picchu in June 1991.... but didn’t!
