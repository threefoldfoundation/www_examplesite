bio = "My purpose is to build a society I would be honored to raise my children in. I envision a more-free, abundant, beautiful, paradise-society and am in service to the concepts, projects and visions that are demanding to be realized. I believe SEEDS is an integral aspect of our future societies that will transition our present culture into a world where people are supported in pursuing their passions and purpose. A world where local, healing-food is abundant and affordable. A world of interconnected collectives and economies that are owned by the people that comprise them. A world where the benefits and our global abundance is more equitably distributed for humanity and all life on our planet to flourish and thrive.I am involved in designing the protocols that comprise SEEDS, Hypha, Hypha DAO (The Peoples DAO), Light Food, Our NeighbourGood and The Heart Collaborative. I help organize and facilitate the progression of SEEDS and hold the space for our story to progress."
