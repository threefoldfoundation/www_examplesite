# Build your own website

We have created a [web publishing tool](https://threefold.io/info/publishtools#/) that allows you to seemlesly build your own web presence on the TF Grid.

To use publishing tool you will first need to set up a publishtools environment. For that follow our [Publishtools install guide](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/www_examplesite/blob/development/manual/install.md)

You can use our examplesite as a template for your new website. All you need to do is copy this (www_examplesite) repo and import it when creating your new websites repository.

Feel free to follow our [website set up checklist](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/www_examplesite/blob/development/manual/website_setup_checklist.md) to make sure you have it all covered.
